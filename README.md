## The "happy" thing

Since interpreting the notion of "happy" is rather subjective, I turned to my friend google and here's the definition that convinced me the most.

> Happy colors are usually thought to be bright, warm shades, like yellow, orange, pink and red, or pastels, like peach, light pink and lilac. The brighter and lighter the color, the happier and more optimistic it can make you feel. Combining lots of colors together can feel joyful and exuberant, like the Holi festival, or maybe a little chaotic and overwhelming, like an overcrowded city street.
